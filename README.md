# Chicago-Crime
## Data wrangling, exploration and visualisation using python

This dataset was generated from the Onecampus Academy library. It is a crime dataset
collected over a period of time from Chicago, USA. It originally contains 2,278,726 entries
and 23 columns of information about individuals who committed crime, and the FBI's
documentation of such crimes in Chicago.
The goal of the project is to wrangle the data, generate insights to the patterns of crime
and create data visualisations to analyse and represent the crime dataset.
